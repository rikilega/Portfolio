            <p>Hi. My name is Richard Aspinall. I have started my coding journey and have 
                created this webpage to practice key skills that we have been learning over the
                course of the first couple of weeks of the bootcamp I am attending. I enjoy
                many things but the thing that gives me joy most of all is spending time with
                my family. My hope for this journey is that I end up in a place where I can 
                provide better for them and spend even more time with them! With or without 
                family I also like to spend time with my Church congregation, try to understand
                programming concepts that went over my head in class, listen to music, play 
                the guitar and engage in some hectic pickleball. The work section of this page
                will take you to some of my previous coding projects, and my contact info is at
                the bottom of the page. Enjoy!
            </p>
