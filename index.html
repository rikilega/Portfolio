            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a 30-year veteran of pickleball, I have had the privilege of witnessing the 
                    growth and evolution of the sport from its humble beginnings to the global 
                    phenomenon it is today. I first discovered pickleball when I was in my twenties, 
                    and instantly fell in love with the fast-paced nature of the game, as well as the 
                    social aspect of playing with friends and making new connections on the court.</p>
